  <div class="contentt">
    <p>In a world not so distant, people relied solely on manual processes to carry out their tasks and activities. In offices, clerks meticulously recorded information by hand, using ink and paper ledgers to keep track of records. Communication was slow, relying on handwritten letters sent through postal services, often taking days or even weeks to reach their destination. <br>

      In the field of mathematics, complex calculations were performed manually using abacuses, slide rules, and other mechanical devices. Scientists and engineers spent hours crunching numbers and solving equations by hand, a process prone to errors and requiring immense patience and precision. <br>
      
      Similarly, in manufacturing and production, workers labored tirelessly on assembly lines, crafting products piece by piece. Every step of the production process, from assembly to quality control, was done manually, leading to inefficiencies and long lead times. <br>
      
      But then, a revolutionary invention changed everythingâ€”the computer. With the advent of computers, tasks that once took days or weeks to complete could now be done in a fraction of the time. Data could be stored, processed, and analyzed with unprecedented speed and accuracy. Communication became instantaneous, with emails replacing handwritten letters and spreadsheets replacing paper ledgers. <br>
      
      In offices, computers transformed the way information was managed and processed. Tasks that were once tedious and time-consuming, such as data entry and record-keeping, were now automated, freeing up time for more strategic and creative work. <br>
      
      In manufacturing, computers revolutionized production processes, leading to increased efficiency, higher quality products, and reduced costs. Automation technologies such as robotics and computer-aided design (CAD) allowed for greater precision and flexibility in manufacturing processes.</p>
    <h1>Computer Science</h1>
    <p>Computer science is the study of computers and computational systems. It involves understanding the theory, design, development, and application of computer systems and software.</p>

    <h4>Computer</h4>
    <p>A computer is an electronic device capable of performing arithmetic and logical operations at high speed, typically under the control of instructions stored in its memory. It consists of hardware components such as the central processing unit (CPU), memory, storage devices, input/output devices, and networking components. Computers process data according to predefined algorithms to produce desired outputs. They come in various forms, including personal computers, laptops, servers, mainframes, and embedded systems. </p>
    <h4>Data</h4>
    <p>Data refers to raw facts, symbols, or values that represent the basic elements of information. It can take various forms, including numbers, text, images, audio, and video. Data by itself has little meaning or context until it is processed and organized. Data can be structured, such as in databases with defined formats and relationships, or unstructured, such as free-form text or multimedia files. In computing, data is manipulated, analyzed, and transformed to derive meaningful insights or to perform specific tasks. </p>

    <h4>Information</h4>
    <p>
     Information is the processed and organized form of data that conveys meaning and context. It results from the interpretation, analysis, and presentation of data within a specific context or framework. Unlike data, which lacks context and relevance on its own, information provides valuable insights, knowledge, or instructions that aid decision-making, communication, and problem-solving. Information can be structured into meaningful patterns, summaries, reports, or visualizations to facilitate understanding and action by individuals or systems. It is essential for making informed decisions, gaining knowledge, and achieving various objectives in different domains.

  <h3>Left Button</h3>
  <p>Typically located on the left side of the mouse, the primary button is the most frequently used button. It is used for selecting, clicking, dragging, and interacting with objects on the screen.</p>
  <h3>Right Button</h3>
  <p>Usually positioned on the right side of the mouse, the secondary button serves various functions depending on the context. It commonly opens context menus, performs secondary actions, and provides right-click functionality in most operating systems.</p>
  <h3>Scroll Wheel</h3>
  <p>The scroll wheel is a small wheel located between the primary and secondary buttons. It allows users to scroll vertically through documents, web pages, or other content displayed on the screen. Pressing the scroll wheel down often acts as a third button, triggering additional functions such as opening links in new tabs or closing windows.</p>
